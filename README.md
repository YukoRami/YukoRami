# About me

This is my personnal account where I post some fun stuff (whenever I feel like it). Don't expect to find smart or interesting ideas here...

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finding the meaning of my work
- 🌱 I’m currently learning sciency stuff and how to write 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm don't know (yet) how to do a cartwheel
- 🐈 Misc: I came up with a magnificent conjecture between physics and econnomy, but the limitations of this README makes it to narrow to write it down
